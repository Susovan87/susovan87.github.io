Hi. I'm Susovan Ghosh.

I'm a software engineer who values lightweight agile processes, TDD, and good design. But above all: shipping.

I enjoy building simple apps that people love using.

I live in Kolkata, India. I did my B.Tech from [Institute of Engineering & Management](http://iem.edu.in/). I do a little bit of everything.

I'm always learning and trying to improve my craft; I consider writing software to be one of my most enjoyable hobbies and usually have some kind of side-project I'm hacking on. I come at problems with an Engineer's Mindset and am always striving to write clean, readable code.
