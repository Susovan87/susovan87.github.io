I finally decided to host and maintain my personal blog in `GitHub pages`. Though I tried it before and `Github` never disappointed me, it's my lazyness :sleeping: which stop me always :angry:.

This time I am with strong determination to post regularly (atleast my daily notes).

Let's see, how it goes :smiley:.
